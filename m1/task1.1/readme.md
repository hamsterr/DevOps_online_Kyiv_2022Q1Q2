# **Task1 of module1**
In this repo I created 4 branches:
+ **master**
+ **develop**
+ **images** 
+ **styles**

*images* - for images

*styles* - for style files

Than styles and images was linked in index.html. And all structure was merged in develop brunch and after in master. All steps are saved in task1.1_GIT.txt with *git reflog* command.

## **What is DevOps**
In my opinion, DevOps is a scope of instruments and practices that helps to improve and accelerate software development. It helps automate routine tasks and concentrate on more challenging work.
